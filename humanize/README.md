# humanize - lightweight human-readable numbers

## About

Package humanize implements lightweight human-readable numbers for Go.

Why use this package?

Compare tawesoft/go/humanize vs dustin/go-humanize: Tawesoft's parses input about 5 times faster with fewer memory
allocations, and formats output about 25% quicker than dustin's. But dustin's is so far more complete, older, has a
stable API, and has been tested by more people.
